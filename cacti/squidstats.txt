Overview:
==========

This is an attempt at using cacti's amazing capabilities to query and plot various metrics
presented by squid over SNMP.

This is a first version, so the graphs may not be 100% perfect. I have tried to create a 
fairly comprehensive catalogue of metrics to view, but if you can think of any more, you're
welcome to give me a shout.

Prerequisites:
================

1. You will need cacti version 0.8.5 - at the time of the release of this version of SquidStats,
   0.8.5 was still in beta release, but there exists no reason why there should be any
   incompatabilities with future releases.
2. The version of Squid that this has been tested with is squid version 2.5STABLE1 with a specific
   bug required for this to work. AFAIK this bug has not been fixed at time of this writing in
   subsequent releases. (The value for cacheServerErrors is always zero and we rely on this fact
   to pull out a fake index of "0".)
3. SNMP libraries and utilities - you wouldn't be able to use cacti without them anyway..









Installation:
==============

This is an attempt at a dummies guide for installation to make it easy with someone that isn't
too familiar with cacti, so please bear with me:

1. Squid Preparation:

	Add the following to your squid.conf file:

          a) An ACL as follows: "acl snmpcommunity snmp_community snmppublic" - 
               you can change "snmppublic" so something else, but you need to use the
               new value in the subsequent steps below.
          b) Enable the snmp port by finding the section that defines "snmp_port" and by changing
               its value to "3401"  - so the line would read "snmp_port 3401"
          c) Enable access permissions to the port in the section where "snmp_access" is defined.
               - A line like "snmp_access allow snmpcommunity localhost" will give permission to
               connections on the localhost using the snmpcommunity community name.
               - You can substitute "localhost" with any other ACL e.g. for a host or a group of
                 hosts from which you want to query the squid snmp port.
               - The last line in the snmp_access section should read "snmp_access deny all" to set
                 the default permission

        Optionally you could proxy the SNMP traffic through a local snmpd, but I won't give the details
        here -- but if you do that, please remember to use the standard "161" port below in stead of 
        "3401".

2. Restart Squid to activate the configuration.

3. Verify your Squid SNMP installation:

	a) You can import the squid mib file (which in my case lives in /etc/squid/mib.txt) by executing

                 export MIBFILES="/etc/squid/mib.txt"

           in my bash shell.

        b) Run a snmpwalk over the squid port as follows (this is the syntax for net-snmp, your library
           may need a different syntax):

                 snmpwalk -c snmppublic -v1 <hostname>:3401 .1.3.6.1.4.1.3495.1

           where <hostname> is the hostname or ip address of your squid server. You will want to do this
           from the cacti server so that you know the permissions in the first step are working correctly.

           If you get a long list of parameters and metrics, then you are well on your way!!

4. Cacti Configuration and SquidStats import :


       1)  Copy the following files into <cacti_path>/resource/snmp_queries:

             a) webcache_squid_core.xml
             b) webcache_squid_median.xml

           These contain the details necessary to determine which OIDs to query in Squid.

       2)  Next import the cacti_host_template_webcache_squid_server_snmp.xml file from the cacti config interface.

           You should be seeing a list of green "success" indicators to show that the imports have worked.

           If something didn't import correctly, please make sure that your cacti 0.8.5 is the latest build, 
           and if you're still stuck, let me know what went wrong.

       3)  Add a new host for your squid instance ("Devices" in the cacti menu on the left) calling it 
           something "Hostname - Squid" or whatever, and associate it with the Squid SNMP host template.

           Supply the fully qualified hostname or IP address in the "Hostname" field.

           You will also need to change the following parameters in the host's defaults:

           SNMP Community = snmppublic
           SNMP Version   = 1
           SNMP Port      = 3401
           
           Once you click "Create" a more detailed page should appear.

           If you see a small red "SNMP Error" message appearing at the top - don't worry this is an expected error
           since cacti tries to obtain host information that squid's snmp doesn't supply. (Although most other snmp
           installations do.)

           The real test to see whether the association of your new host and the Squid Host template worked is in the
           block called "Associated Data Queries". There should be two data query entries, and both of them should have
           a green "Success" indicator showing that the queries succeeded. 

           The first query (Core) should have 1 Item and 1 Row, and the second (Median Based) should have 3 Items and
           3 Rows.

           WELL DONE !! If you've gotten this far, you should now be ready to activate the graphs you want !!

5. SquidStats Graph generation:

           From the host page ("Devices") or the page you should be on from the previous step, or the new graphs page, select
           "Create Graphs for this Host" (first the new host you created if it isn't in your screen already).

           You should see two data query blocks. The first one should have your squid version on the left and a drop-down on the
           right hand side with various graphs to choose from. The second will have "1","5","60" on the left and a drop-down on 
           the right to select various graphs. You will always want to choose "5" from the second one, since these are 5 minute
           averages that squid supplies, and cacti usually queries it every 5 minutes.

           To generate a new graph simply select from the drop down on the right, check the box as appropriate and described in
           the previous paragraph (it'll turn yellow), and press "create".

           The final step is to add your host to whichever graph tree you want using the "Graph Trees" menu.

6. Which statistics to choose from:

           OK, so there are 14 graphs, some of which are probably cryptic or boring, so which are the ones that a new installation
           should have. I would recommend the following:

           (Data Query)        (Name)              (Description)
           Core -          Cache Hit Rate:         Cache hits as a percentage of overall bytes/requests transferred to clients
           Core -          CPU Usage:              The percentage of your system's CPU that squid is using
           Core -          Traffic In/Out/Saved:   Incoming and outgoing traffic (including the cache saving) - similar to a network interface
           Median Based -  Client Request Rate:    Shows the number of client requests to the cache (hits,misses,total)
           Median Based -  Service Timers:         A stack view of different activities required to service a request

           These should give you a good basis to start, and you could then add the others later as you want to see more detail.


Have I missed anything?

Good Luck,
Rolf.
