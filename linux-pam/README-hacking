No more ChangeLog file
======================
Do not create or modify the ChangeLog files.  Starting at 2011-10-26, the
policy changed.  Before, we would insert the exact same text (or worse,
sometimes slightly differing) into both the ChangeLog file and the commit
log.  Now we put that information only in the commit log, and generate
the ChangeLog file from logs at "make dist" time.  As such, there are
strict requirements on the form of the commit log messages.


Commit log requirements
=======================
Each commit log should always start with a one-line summary, the second
line should be blank, and the remaining lines are usually ChangeLog-style
entries for all affected files, except the leading TABs which should
be omitted.  It's OK to write a few lines of prose describing the change,
when the summary and ChangeLog entries don't give enough of the big picture.
