	<h1 align=center>mod_auth_pam Installation Instructions</h1>

	<h2>Requirements</h2>

	<dl>
	<dt>Apache, v1.3.x<dd>Apache is the worlds most widely used
	web-server and included with all Linux distributions I know
	of. The current source code, in case you want to compile it
	yourself, can be retrieved from: <a
	href="http://www.apache.org/dist/">http://www.apache.org/dist/</a>
	<dt>Linux-PAM 0.64+ (0.68 or higher is recommended)<dd> If
	your system does not include Linux-PAM by default, this module
	is probably not what you want!
	<dd><a href="http://www.de.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">more information on Linux-PAM</a>
	</dl>

	<h2>Compiling the source code</h2>

	If this is your first Apache module, skip the following
	paragraph and go directly to <a href="#dso">dynamic shared
	object module</a>.
	<p>
	mod_auth_pam is as standard as it gets with respect to module
	installation, so if you are familiar with installing and using
	3rd party modules, you should have no trouble at all and can
	use any of the supported installation methods. I
	<em>strongly</em> recommend using the DSO method, as it is by
	far the easiest way and will give you a working system in no
	time. If you are looking for more information, the Apache
	Group has written <a
	href="http://www.apache.org/docs/dso.html">a very detailed
	explanation of DSO modules</a>.
	<p>
	Now, here's what you have to do:

	<ul>
	<li><a name="dso">dynamic shared object</a> (DSO) module
	<p align="justify">
		<ol>
		<li><tt>cd</tt> to the directory where you unpacked the sources
		<li>Type "<tt>make</tt>" and then "<tt>make install</tt>"
		<li>Restart Apache
		</ol>
	</p>
	<li>static module
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Put <tt>mod_auth_pam.c</tt> into the <tt>src/modules/extra</tt> directory of your Apache source-tree
		<li>configure with <tt>LIBS="-lpam -ldl" ./configure --activate-module=src/modules/extra/mod_auth_pam.o</tt> (all on one line and in addition ot any other options you usually require)
		<li>Proceed with compilation and installation as usual
	</ol>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	If everything went smoothly, proceed with <a
	href="configure.html">Configuring mod_auth_pam</a>. If you ran
	into an error, please check out the <a
	href="http://www.apache.org/docs/dso.html">Apache Guide to
	DSO's</a>.
