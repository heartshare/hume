	<h2>Configuring PAM</h2>

	If you went with the DSO installation above, a default httpd
	configuration file for mod_auth_pam will have been created for
	you in <tt>/etc/pam.d/httpd</tt>. It should work out of the
	box, if you kept a standard PAM installation (if you never
	looked at that directory before, thats probably the case). If
	you modified you PAM configuration before, apply the same
	changes to the httpd service configuration.
	<p>
	Further information:
	<ul>
	<li>The <a
	href="http://www.de.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/Linux-PAM-html/pam.html">Linux-PAM
	System Administrators' Guide</a> describes the service
	configuration files <li>The <a href="faq.html">Frequently
	Asked Questions</a> list describes a few pecularities that
	only happen with specific pam-modules (for example, pam_smb)
	</ul>

	<h2>Apache configuration</h2>

	Apache will automatically start using mod_auth_pam once you
	compiled it in. You use the normal directives to configure
	mod_auth_pam. An example <tt>.htaccess</tt> (also included as
	<tt>samples/dot-htaccess</tt> in the distribution) might look
	like
<pre>
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "secure area"
	require group staff
	require user webmaster
</pre>
	which would result in the protected directory being accessible
	only by members of the "staff" group and by the user
	"webmaster". For more information, see <a
	href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#authtype">AuthType</a>,
	<a
	href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#authname">AuthName</a>
	and <a
	href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#require">require</a>.

	<h5>Configuration Directives</h5>

	<p>Because a server might contain several authentication
	modules, mod_auth_pam includes directives to improve
	interaction with other authentication modules.</p>

	<dl>
	<dt><strong>AuthPAM_Enabled</strong>
	<dd><strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthPAM_Enabled
	<strong>on</strong> or <strong>off</strong>
	<dd><strong>Default:</strong> AuthPAM_Enabled on
	<dd><strong>Context: </strong> directory, .htaccess
	<dd><p>This directive turns mod_auth_pam on or off. If turned
	off, the server will behave as if mod_auth_pam is not
	there.</p> <dt><strong>AuthPAM_FallThrough</strong>
	<dd><strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthPAM_FallThrough <em>on</em>
	or <em>off</em> <dd><strong>Default:</strong>
	AuthPAM_FallThrough off <dd><strong>Context:</strong>
	directory, .htaccess <dd><p>Access policy if a username is not
	found. This directive is usefull if multiple authentication
	modules are used. In case a given username is not found by
	mod_auth_pam, normal behaviour is to directly return an error
	to the user, thus bypassing other authentication
	modules. Switching AuthPAM_Fallthrough on will make Apache ask
	other authentication modules if mod_auth_pam can't find the
	user.</p>
